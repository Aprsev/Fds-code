# Autograd for Algebraic Expressions
## How to execute 
Use your complier to compile and run the "autograd.c" program.
## How to run the program
To run the program you simply need to input the target infix expression. 
note that infix should follow the rule of:
- the operator available is +,-,*,/,(,)
- you  should input * as multiplication because ab will be regarded as a single variable
- complicated functions like sin(),log() should be avoided
The program will print out the following things:
1. the postfix expression of you infix expression.
2. numbers of variables 
3. answers for differentiation of each variable
