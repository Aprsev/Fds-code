C，最大值可以有一个左子树，其中包含最后一个节点

In a weighted undirected graph, if the length of the shortest path from `b` to `a` is 12, and there exists an edge of weight 2 between `c` and `b`, then the length of the shortest path from `c` to `a` must be no less than 10.

The function `unweighted` is to find the unweighted shortest path from `Vertex S` to every other vertices in a given `Graph`. The distances are stored in `dist[]`, and `path[]` records the paths. The `Graph` is defined as the following:
```c
typedef struct GMode +PtrToMode;
struct GMode{
    int Nv; // Number of vertices */
    int Ne; // Number of edges */
    AdjList List; // adjacency matrix */
};
typedef PtrToMode Graph;
```

During the sorting, processing every element which is not yet at its final position is called a "run". Which of the following cannot be the result after the second run of quicksort?

A. 5, 2, 16, 12, 28, 60, 32, 72
B. 2, 16, 5, 28, 12, 60, 32, 72 
C. 2, 12, 16, 5, 28, 32, 72, 60 
D. 5, 2, 12, 28, 16, 32, 72, 60

When selecting a sorting algorithm, which of the following factors must be taken into consideration besides the time and space complexities?

- I、the size of input data
- II、the structure used to store the data
- III、the stability of the algorithm
- IV、the initial condition of the data

A. III only 
B. I and II only 
C. II, III and IV only 
D. I, II, III and IV
